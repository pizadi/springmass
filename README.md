# Spring Mass Simulations

This repo is made to demonstrate some basic implementations of a mass-spring system in C++, using Eigen and OpenGL libraries.

## 2D Spring-Mass System

A 2-d implementation using eigen.

## Naive 3D implementation

A 3-d implementation which does not use eigen. You can control the perspective by moving your mouse.

## 3D Implementation with Eigen

A 3-d implementation with Eigen which reads mass and spring data from csv files. You can control the perspective with IJKL keys.
